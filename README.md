# Microcontroller-for-Boiler-Control
Temperature monitoring in a boiler system at 4 points. For prouduct; at source of heat and at top of reflux column.
For cooling system; at source of cooling water and at return.
Monitoring of flow rate of cooling water.
There is a web server to display a graphic showing temperatures in their correct places
There is a SD card reader for recording temperatures and flow rates for logging
